#Kiptere Non Govermental Organisation

Imagine students in rural Kenya using computers and reading books!
We aim to connect and engage teachers and students in Kericho County with the skills
and computer technology necesary to navigate and increasingly digital world.

Many students in Kenya and Kericho finish form 4 without the computer skills necesary for daily use. Most just see computers in Cybers. 

We want to supply school with the necesary equipment such as computers so students can learn computer usage.
